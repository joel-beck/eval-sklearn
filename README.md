# My Scikit-Learn Journey

This repository follows along my learning path of the popular Python library `Scikit-Learn`.
Throughout this project I aim to conform to best practices of the `Scikit-Learn` community in the year 2022 and eventually approach some more advanced features of the library.

All code will be reproducible. For this purpose I provide a `environment.yml` file to install all required packages into a `conda` environment, which can be created with the command

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Apart from `scikit-learn` itself, I will make use of the related packages `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization as well as `xgboost` and `lightgbm` for additional modeling based on Gradient Boosting.

Apart from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) rabbit holes and various blog posts this project is mainly build upon the two excellent textbooks

- Sebastian Raschka et al.: Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn (2022)
- Andreas MÃ¼ller, Sarah Guido: Introduction to Machine Learning with Python (2016)

and the fantastic [Scikit Learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Since this repository primarily serves as my own reference, it will certainly lack extensive documentation and explanations.
I invite you to scroll through the code nonetheless to discover some `Scikit-Learn` gems that might be useful in your own projects.
